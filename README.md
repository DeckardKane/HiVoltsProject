HiVoltsProject
==============

This is a repo for our HiVolts assignment in our AP Computer Science Class.

###Who are we?
We're a group of high school students taking the AP Computer Science Class.

###What is this assignment?
The mission is to recreate a 1970's computer game known as HiVolts, using our knowledge we've gained so far
and our previous knowledge from Conway's Game of Life and similar projects.

###How do I run this?
These points of data make a beautiful line, and we're out of beta, we're releasing on time! Version 1.0 has been released! You can run our game by downloading the jar executable file and simply clicking it. 

###Can I fork this?
We're not sure why you'd want to do that, but feel free to send a request to DoctorRyuko.
