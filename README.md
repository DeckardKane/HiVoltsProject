HiVoltsProject
==============

This is a repo for our HiVolts assignment in our AP Computer Science Class.

###Who are we?
We're a group of high school students taking the AP Computer Science Class.

###What is this assignment?
The mission is to recreate a 1970's computer game known as HiVolts, using our knowledge we've gained so far
and our previous knowledge from Conway's Game of Life and similar projects.

###How do I run this?
Well, it's not fully functional as of 10/6, but if you really want to run at this point, you'll need an IDE. When our project is complete (hopefully by 10/9!), we'll have a click to run file available.

###Can I fork this?
We're not sure why you'd want to do that, but feel free to send a request to DoctorRyuko.
