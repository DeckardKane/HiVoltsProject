HiVoltsProject
==============

This is a repo for our HiVolts assignment in our AP Computer Science Class.

##Who are we?
We're a group of high schools taking the AP Computer Science Class.

##What is this assignment?
The mission is to recreate a 1970's computer game known as HiVolts, using our knowledge we've gained so far
and our previous knowledge from Conway's Game of Life and similar projects.

##Can I fork this?
We're not sure why you'd want to do that, but feel free to send a request to DoctorRyuko.
